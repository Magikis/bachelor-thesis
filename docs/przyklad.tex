\chapter{Introduction}

That's why companies around the globe put a lot of effort into making the car software for autonomous driving. It is very interesting task from artificial intelligence perspective. During my work I wanted approach the problem by building my own agent capable of drive safely on a racing track.




\section{TORCS Environment}
"The online racing car simulator"(TORCS) is highly portable, multi platform car simulator, with various cars and tracks.  The simulation features a simple damage model, collisions, fuel consumption, tire and wheel properties (springs, dampers, stiffness), aerodynamics and much more. It is designed to enable programed agents compete against each others. There is very ditalied instruction for developing yourn own bot. However the game and bots as well is written in C++ language.

\end{figure}
From the beginning I really wanted to use python language, so TORCS environment did not meet all my expectations. 


\section{Simulated Car Racing Championship}

SCRC competition took place between 2007 - 2015 with some breaks. It was organized by the University of Adelaide and the Politecnico de Milano. THey used TORCS engine for competition, but organizers provided official patch which changed architecture of the programme. After patching, TORCS became client-server application which allows multiple bots communicate with game engine via UDP connections.

Server sends current sensor inputs (track border, speed, lap time, etc...) and waits for 20ms for the client action (gas, break, steer, etc...). API is details are descrived in table from manual. With that change participants cant choose whatever language they want. That's why I decided to use patched version of TORCS game engine in version 1.3.7

Organizers provided "clients" programmes only in Java and C++. I didn't want to implement communication interface on my own, beacuse it's time consuming  and uninteresting task. After some research,  I found \url{http://xed.ch/p/snakeoil} project, which provides Python Class handling communication with TORCS server. It allowed me to add layer of abstraction and focus directly on driving functionality.

\section{Game sensors and actions}
    



\chapter{Experiments}

\section{Line follower}

The first approach to the problem was developing simple bot which follows the middle line of the track. It uses following parameters: PosTrack. angle, sppedX

\chapter{Adidtonal Problems}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transmission} Choosen architecture didn't allowed me to use automatic transmission included with the torcs game. I had to build my own basic automatic transmission system, which is far from perfect. I haven't change it during development of different agents, so all results are comparable. 
\end{itemize}

     \hline
     \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Range (unit)} & \textbf{Description} \\ 
     \hline
     angle & $[-\pi, +\pi]$ (rad) & Angle between the car direction and the direction the track axis. \\  
     \hline
     curLapTime & $[0, +\infty)$ (s) & Time elapsed during current lap. \\
     \hline
     damage & $(0, +\infty)$ (point) & Current damage of the car (the higher is the value the higher is the damage). \\
     \hline
     distFromStart & $[0, +\infty)$ (m) & Distance of the car from the start line along the track line. \\
     \hline
     distRaced & $[0, +\infty)$ (m) & Distance covered by the car from the beginning of the race \\
     \hline
     focus & $[0, 200]$ (m) & Vector of 5 range finder sensors: each sensor returns the distance between the track edge and the car within a range of 200 meters. When noisy option is enabled (see Section 7) sensors are affected by i.i.d. normal noises with a standard deviation equal to the $1\%$ of sensors range. The sensors sample, with a resolution of one degree, a five degree space along a specific direction provided by the client (the direction is defined with the focus command and must be in the range $[-90,+90]$ degrees w.r.t. the car axis). Focus sensors are not always available: they can be used only once per second of simulated time. When the car is outside of the track (i.e., pos is less than $-1$ or greater than $1$), the focus direction is outside the allowed range ($[-90,+90]$ degrees) or the sensors has been already used once in the last second, the returned values are not reliable (typically $-1$ is returned). \\
     \hline
     fuel & $[0, +\infty)$ (l) & Current fuel level. \\
     \hline
     gear & $ \{ -1,0,1, \dots, 6 \} $ & Current gear: -1 is reverse, 0 is neutral and the gear from 1 to 6. \\
     \hline
     lastLapTime & $[0, +\infty)$ (s) & Time to complete the last lap \\
     \hline
     opponents & $[0, 200]$ (m) & Vector of 36 opponent sensors: each sensor covers a span of 10 degrees within a range of 200 meters and returns the distance of the closest opponent in the covered area. When noisy option is enabled, sensors are affected by i.i.d. normal noises with a standard deviation equal to the $2\%$ of sensors range. The 36 sensors cover all the space around the car, spanning clockwise from $-180$ degrees up to $+180$ degrees with respect to the car axis. \\
     \hline
     racePos & $\{1,2,\dots,N\}$ & Position in the race with respect to other cars. \\
     \hline
     rpm & $[0, +\infty)$ (rpm) & Number of rotation per minute of the car engine \\
     \hline
     speedX & $ ( -\infty, +\infty ) $ (km/h) & Speed of the car along the longitudinal axis of the car. \\
     \hline
     speedY & $ ( -\infty, +\infty ) $ (km/h) & Speed of the car along the transverse axis of the car. \\
     \hline
     speedZ & $ ( -\infty, +\infty ) $ (km/h) & Speed of the car along the Z axis of the car \\
     \hline        
     track &  $[0, 200]$ (m) & Vector of 19 range finder sensors: each sensors returns the distance between the track edge and the car within a range of 200 meters. When noisy option is enabled, sensors are affected by i.i.d. normal noises with a standard deviation equal to the $10\%$ of sensors range. By default, the sensors sample the space in front of the car every 10 degrees, spanning clockwise from $-90$ degrees up to $+90$ degrees with respect to the car axis. However, the configuration of the range finder sensors (i.e., the angle w.r.t. to the car axis) can be set by the client once during initialization, i.e., before the beginning of each race. When the car is outside of the track (i.e., pos is less than $-1$ or greater than $1$), the returned values are not reliable (typically $-1$ is returned). \\
     \hline
     trackPos & $( -\infty, +\infty )$ & Distance between the car and the track axis. The value is normalized w.r.t to the track width: it is $0$ when car is on the axis, $-1$ when the car is on the right edge of the track and $+1$ when it is on the left edge of the car. Values greater than $1$ or smaller than $-1$ mean that the car is outside of the track. \\
     \hline
     wheelSpinVel & $[0, +\infty)$ (rad/s) & Vector of 4 sensors representing the rotation speed of wheels. \\
     \hline
     z & $( -\infty, +\infty ) $ (km/h) & Distance of the car mass center from the surface of the track
     along the Z axis \\
